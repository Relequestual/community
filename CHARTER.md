# JSON Schema Charter
<!-- This document is managed in the json-schema-org/community GitHub repository. Please do NOT modify this file in another repository as changes may be overridden. -->

## 0: Guiding Principles
The JSON Schema project is part of the OpenJS Foundation. The JSON Schema project strives to be open and transparent as much as is possible, and wish to enable anyone to interact and engage with any area of our work.

Having no structure in place usually leads to one that is informal and undocumented, making it difficult to meet our own expectations of how the TSC wish to operate. As such, the JSON Schema project define the following charter which includes aspects of the governance model to which the TSC subscribe and by which the TSC operate.

## 1: Scope
JSON Schema aims to enable the confident and reliable use of the JSON data format. It does this primarily by providing specification documents which define a declarative language that allows annotation and validation of JSON documents.
While JSON Schema's primary target is constraint-based data validation, it continues to be used across the whole stack, in different stages of a given project, and for purposes beyond its original design. The JSON Schema project aims to enable these additional and emergent use cases.

### 1.1: In-scope
The scope of the JSON Schema project is split into two sections: primary and secondary concerns.
Primary concerns are areas the JSON Schema project wish to give focus to. Secondary concerns, while remaining in scope, aren't areas of focus, and would require dedicated championing by community members to come to fruition.

Primary Concerns
- Publication of the JSON Schema standard
  - Validation of JSON-compatible data
  - Semantic annotation of JSON-compatible data
  - Interoperability
  - Extensibility
- Critical tooling
- Documentation
- Test suite
- Community
  - Enabling schema authors
  - Enabling implementers
  - Engaging with industry
  - Engaging with upstream and downstream standards and projects
  - Communicating value
  - Ensuring the sustainability of the project

Secondary Concerns
- Hypermedia
- Generating JSON Schema
- Using JSON Schema to generate
  - Code (including types or classes)
  - UI (including forms)
  - Databases
- Relational validation
- Vocabularies registry

### 1.2: Out-of-Scope
Standards that the JSON Schema project uses (such as JSON and IRI), nor standards and projects that use JSON Schema (such as OpenAPI and AsyncAPI), are not things which the JSON Schema project has any control over.

## 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC.
Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a technical governance model. Technical leadership for the projects within the OpenJS Foundation is delegated to the projects through their project charters by the OpenJS Cross Project Council (CPC). In the case of the JSON Schema project, it is delegated to the JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee ("TSC").

### 2.1 Other Formal Project Relationships
Section Intentionally Left Blank

## 3: JSON Schema Governing Body (TSC)
The JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is initially established from the observed major contributors who are currently active and in good standing.

The TSC must have a minimum of four members. There is no maximum TSC membership size.

TSC memberships are not time-limited.

The TSC follows the decision-making process defined in this charter unless otherwise documented.

The TSC aims to work asynchronously. TSC meetings are pre-announced, public, and recorded. Minutes are taken and the recordings made available. If there is a reasonable reason (such as security or privacy), any portion of a meeting, its minutes, and recording, may be kept private.

## 4: Roles & Responsibilities

See GOVERNANCE.md

### 4.1 Project Operations & Management
The TSC and entire technical community will follow any processes as may be specified by the OpenJS Foundation Board relating to the intake and license compliance review of contributions, including the OpenJS Foundation IP Policy.

#### Decision-making via consensus and voting, and documenting decisions

See GOVERNANCE.md

## 5: Definitions

TSC: The JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee, delegated technical leadership for the JSON Schema project by the OpenJS Foundation.
