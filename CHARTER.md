# JSON Schema Charter
<!-- This document is managed in the json-schema-org/community GitHub repository. Please do NOT modify this file in another repository as changes may be overridden. -->

## 0: Guiding Principles
The JSON Schema project is part of the OpenJS Foundation. The JSON Schema project strives to be open and transparent as much as is possible, and wish to enable anyone to interact and engage with any area of our work.

Technical leadership for the projects within the OpenJS Foundation is delegated to the projects through their project charters by the OpenJS Cross Project Council (CPC). In the case of the JSON Schema project, it is delegated to the JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee ("TSC"). OpenJS Foundation's business leadership is the Board of Directors (the "Board").

Having no structure in place usually leads to one that is informal and undocumented, making it difficult to meet our own expectations of how the TSC wish to operate. As such, the JSON Schema project define the following charter which includes aspects of the governance model to which the TSC subscribe and by which the TSC operate.

## 1: Scope
JSON Schema aims to enable the confident and reliable use of the JSON data format. It does this primarily by providing specification documents which define a declarative language that allows annotation and validation of JSON documents.
While JSON Schema's primary target is constraint-based data validation, it continues to be used across the whole stack, in different stages of a given project, and for purposes beyond its original design. The JSON Schema project aims to enable these additional and emergent use cases.

### 1.1: In-scope
The scope of the JSON Schema project is split into two sections: primary and secondary concerns.
Primary concerns are areas the JSON Schema project wish to give focus to, while secondary concerns are more likely to require the desire of the community to drive the work.

Primary Concerns
- Publication of the JSON Schema standard
  - Validation of JSON data
  - Semantic annotation of JSON data
  - Extensibility
- Critical tooling
- Documentation
- Test suite
- Community
  - Enabling schema authors
  - Enabling implementers
  - Engaging with industry
  - Communicating value
  - Ensuring the sustainability of the project

Secondary Concerns
- Hypermedia
- Generating JSON Schema
- Using JSON Schema to generate
  - Code (including types or classes)
  - UI (including forms)
  - Databases
- Relational validation
- Vocabularies registry

### 1.2: Out-of-Scope
While the JSON Schema project has no control over the specifications it uses (such as JSON and IRI), nor specifications that use JSON Schema (such as OpenAPI and AsyncAPI), the JSON Schema project has, and continues to, provide expert opinion, advice, and support, as time allows. JSON Schema recognizes the importance and value of the ecosystem surrounding JSON Schema, and JSON Schema encourage those developing standards and tooling to reach out at any time.

## 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC.
Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a technical governance model. Technical leadership for the projects within the OpenJS Foundation is delegated to the projects through their project charters by the OpenJS Cross Project Council (CPC). In the case of the JSON Schema project, it is delegated to the JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee ("TSC").

## 3: JSON Schema Governing Body (TSC)

See GOVERNANCE.md

## 4: Roles & Responsibilities

See GOVERNANCE.md

### 4.1 Project Operations & Management
The TSC and entire technical community will follow any processes as may be specified by the OpenJS Foundation Board relating to the intake and license compliance review of contributions, including the OpenJS Foundation IP Policy.

### 4.2: Decision-making and Voting
The TSC follows a formal consensus seeking decision making model.
In some situations, a vote may be preferable, however a vote will not be used to make the vast majority of decisions.
In the unlikely case where it seems that consensus cannot be reached after multiple attempts, the decision process may be moved to resolve via a vote. This is not expected to happen, but defined as a backup.

#### Decision-making via consensus and voting, and documenting decisions

See GOVERNANCE.md

### 4.3: Other Project Roles

The JSON Schema project recognizes the need for both technical and non-technical roles. While the OpenJS Foundation takes on business responsibilities as the legal entity hosting the project, there are other non-technical responsibilities.

The TSC will look to create other roles as appropriate, and may update this document in accordance with the requirements for doing so, to formally recognize the additional roles.

The following responsibilities are recognized as those requiring roles to be defined by the TSC:
- Community and Industry connections
- Brand awareness, recognition, and health
- Education and training

## 5: Definitions

TSC: The JSON Schema Technical Steering Committee, delegated technical leadership for the JSON Schema project by the OpenJS Foundation.
