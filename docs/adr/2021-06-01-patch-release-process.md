Technical Story: https://github.com/json-schema-org/community/discussions/7

## Context and Problem Statement

JSON Schema has no formalised release process. Currently, we kind of release when we feel there's enough to bundle into a release, with a vague notion of IETF drafts expiring after 6 months.

We want to have a reliable release cadence, to allow us to set pace, but also so others know what to expect.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* We have occasionally found small fixes or clarifications would be helpful
* We want to respond to feedback without having to wait a year due to slow processes

## Considered Options

We didn't formally consider any other options. No alternative proposals were offered.

## Decision Outcome


There were several agreements and comments, but no objections.
We felt this change and formal schedule of a release process made sense over "*shrugs* whatever".
A formal documented release schedule gives us something to aim for, and it can be revised if we feel it is not or does not work for the project.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

JSON Schema has a release schedule plan which people can develop and plan around.
This should make choosing a version and planning upgrades something that can be done with consideration of timelines.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

There may be some additional pressure to create the releases to a schedule.
